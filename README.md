#  Recipe App

A modern iOS application built with SwiftUI that allows users to browse and view recipes with an emphasis on performance and user experience.

## Architecture

### Overview
The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern with the following key components:

```swift
Recipe App
├── Views
│   ├── RecipeListView
│   ├── RecipeRowView
│   └── ErrorView
├── ViewModels
│   └── RecipeViewModel
├── Models
│   └── Recipe
├── Services
│   ├── RecipeService
│   └── ImageLoader
└── Utilities
    └── ImageCache



Key Components


Views
* RecipeListView: Main view that displays the list of recipes
* RecipeRowView: Individual recipe cell with image and details
* ErrorView: Reusable error view with retry functionality

ViewModels

RecipeViewModel: Manages recipe data and business logic
* Handles data fetching
* Manages loading states
* Error handling


Services
* RecipeService: Handles API communication
* ImageLoader: Manages image downloading and caching


Key Features


Efficient Data Loading
* Asynchronous data fetching using async/await
* Pull-to-refresh functionality
* Loading states with progress indicator


Image Management
* Lazy image loading
* Image caching system
* Placeholder images for missing content


Performance Optimizations
* LazyVStack for efficient memory usage
* Singleton ImageCache
* View recycling through ViewBuilder
* Modular components for better maintainability


Error Handling
* Dedicated error view
* Retry functionality
* User-friendly error messages



Technical Decisions
Why MVVM?
* Clear separation of concerns
* Better testability
* SwiftUI's natural fit with MVVM
* Easier state management


Performance Considerations

1. Image Caching
extension ImageCache {
    static let shared = ImageCache()
}
* Singleton pattern to avoid multiple cache instances
* Efficient memory usage

2. Lazy Loading
ScrollView {
    LazyVStack(spacing: 12) {
        ForEach(viewModel.recipes) { recipe in
            RecipeRowView(recipe: recipe)
        }
    }
}
* Only loads views when needed
* Better memory management
* Smooth scrolling experience

3. View Modularity
* Components broken down for reusability
* Better maintenance and testing
* Clearer responsibility separation


Future Improvements

1. Data Persistence
* Implement CoreData or Realm for offline support
* Save favorite recipes


2. Enhanced UI
* Recipe detail view
* Category filtering
* Search functionality
* Recipe sharing options


3. Performance
* Image pre-loading for visible cells
* Pagination for large recipe lists
* Better cache management

4. Testing
* UI tests for critical flows
* Integration tests for services



Setup and Installation
